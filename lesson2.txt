What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

- Git initally creates the directory to house the meta-data and it's required so that Git
can start tracking verions.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

- This is the area that houses the changes to be committed.  It allows you to identify specific changes that you'd
like to track and update within the repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

- By reviewing the staging area, one is able to ensure that only the intended changes will
be commited to the repository.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

- Branching permits developers to experiment, try new ideas & methods while still maintaining a stable version.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

- Diagrams permit you to see each branch tip and parent, allowing you to deeply understand their relationships

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

- The result is a unified branch, it's represented on the diagram (as a new commit) since it literally is
the unified versions of the code.

What are the pros and cons of Git’s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

- Automatic makes the mindless, typically non-invasive changes between two branches, painless.
Manually, means you always have to complete a merge/commit to resolve a changeset, which might
include several files, etc...
