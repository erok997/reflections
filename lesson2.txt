What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

- Git initally creates the directory to house the meta-data and it's required so that Git
can start tracking verions.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

- This is the area that houses the changes to be committed.  It allows you to identify specific changes that you'd
like to track and update within the repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

- By reviewing the staging area, one is able to ensure that only the intended changes will
be commited to the repository.
