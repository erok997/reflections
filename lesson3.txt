When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- When sharing with geographically diverse users, mulitple workstations, etc.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- Manually pulling the changes allows the user to not get "surprised" by whatever changes
were made upstream

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

- Clones are copies of repositories, including all the merges & branches.
- Forks are specific to GitHub and fundamentally the same as a clone.
- Branches are code paths within a repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

- By having the last known state, you're able to see what future changes would get merged with your changes.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

- Wihtout using github, you'd have to coordinate access, probably via ssh to a server reachable by all
the collaborators
