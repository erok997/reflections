When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- When sharing with geographically diverse users, mulitple workstations, etc.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- Manually pulling the changes allows the user to not get "surprised" by whatever changes
were made upstream
