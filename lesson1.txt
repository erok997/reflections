How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

- diff highlights (sometimes, with color) the specific lines that are different
and therefore makes it very easy to spot the changes made.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

- You would be able to determine all the changes and decipher the logic used to
get tp the current version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

- Once you decided to commit, you establishing a logical break-point or completed
function/feature.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

- Different workflows... git is used for projects, where Google Docs is used for
something like papers, or single documents.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

- log will list all the commits, their messages and the changes.  diff will show
the actual changes between two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

- It's like a safety net... if you can always get back, you're more willing
to experiment and break stuff.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

- The RSA ACE API thing.
